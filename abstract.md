# Diaper Your Children: Cleaning Up After Messy React Components

Putting React Components in diapers sounds pretty silly. What is this?

This is the story of a quest. It's a quest to build a robust error handling
solution for a high traffic website. It's an exploration of the edges of React.
It's a mission to protect component builders from themselves. 

Basic understanding of React lifecycle methods is recommended for the audience, but 
the challenges and journey will be presented in a way to be accessible for anyone.

Come and join us for a humorous story of a team taking back their website from
unpredictable errors and malformed data.
